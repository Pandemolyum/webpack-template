# webpack-template
A webpack template consisting of two webpack configuration files for development and production.

To use template, create new repo only with the main branch and use `git reset --hard origin/[branch-name]` to overwrite local repo with the desired branch. Then, use `git push -f origin main` to update remote repo.
